Problem #1:

Given an array of positive integers and an integer sum, find the maximum number of elements in the given array that sum up to sum.

	max_num_of_ele(10, [10, 3, 7]) = 2 
	max_num_of_ele(3, [1, 1, 2, 1 ]) = 3

	Input 1 (sum) → integer : A None negative integer
	Input 2 (list) → array.integer : Array of Positive integers
	
	Output → integer : Maximum number of elements that sum up to sum. Return 0 if it can't be done.


Problem #2:

Find the element that appears once in a sorted array.

Given a sorted array in which all elements appear twice (one after one) and one element appears only once. 

Example:

Input:   arr[] = {1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8}
Output:  4

Input:   arr[] = {1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8}
Output:  8
